      OBJECTIVE:
        Write some javascript that fills this ul with markup identical to the sample above.

      RULES:
        * Use the JSON you can retrieve from this URL: https://theme.co/dev-trial/AqsYKrxkGNBsZupFkqQrWwtqGDyWMnApNciyUVp/data.php
        * Wrap your code in a self executing anonymous function
        * DO NOT share this URL, or your solution with anyone
        * Do not load additional libraries or frameworks. We've included jQuery and underscore.js for you to optionally use in your code

      CONSIDERATIONS:
        * The styling is not important.
        * Your choice of library (or lack thereof) won't affect our assessment. We're simply looking for an efficient solution, and want to offer some tools to speed things up for you.
        * We will test your code by copy and pasting it into the javascript console on this page.

      SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:
        Create a secret gist (on GitHub) containing your solution. The gist should only contain javascript, with your main self executing function.
        Respond on our email conversation (info@theme.co) with a link to your gist
